# Mini Projects in Data Structures and Algorithms

Small miniprojects for various data structures/algorithms
Each DSA has a small project associated with it work with implementation and practical use.
Each will generally use a different language from one another to improve familiarity with different languages as well.

## Projects:

### Turing Machine

Using Python, the first project fully implements a Turing Machine using a Doubly Linked List. The Turing Machine takes the input and states
directly, and the activation function by file. It allows fully computing the given problem, or seeing each step individually. Future support
will be added for manipulating Turing Machines in relatively bizzare way (comparisons, adding them, etc) under some circumstances.

The Doubly Linked List used for the Turing Machine supports a much wider array of operations than is utilized, including adding/removing anywhere,
printing the reverse of the contents, and significant operator overloading.

The goal was to start with a simple but interesting miniproject before moving onto more unfamiliar places.

### Computational Geometry

I don't have a specific goal in mind yet, but I want to implement a DCEL and some computational geometry algorithms
to get more practical experience in this realm of coding. I figured C++ would be a solid choice for this. Some algorithms will require some other data structures like balanced binary trees, heaps, stacks, etc - all of these
will naturally be self implemented.

## Todo:

LinkedList - Python -> Turing Machine

Persistent Red Black Trees - C++ -> Point Location

Doubly Connected Edge List - C++

Priority Queue - Javascript -> Reading Queue (Currently abandoned)
