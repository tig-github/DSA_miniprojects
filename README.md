# Mini Projects in Data Structures and Algorithms

Small miniprojects for various data structures/algorithms
Each DSA has a small project associated with it work with implementation and practical use.
Each will generally use a different language from one another to improve familiarity with different languages as well.

## Projects:

### Turing Machine

Using Python, the first project fully implements a Turing Machine using a Doubly Linked List. The Turing Machine takes the input and states
directly, and the activation function by file. It allows fully computing the given problem, or seeing each step individually. Future support
will be added for manipulating Turing Machines in relatively bizzare way (comparisons, adding them, etc) under some circumstances.

The Doubly Linked List used for the Turing Machine supports a much wider array of operations than is utilized, including adding/removing anywhere,
printing the reverse of the contents, and significant operator overloading.

The goal was to start with a simple but interesting miniproject before moving onto more unfamiliar places.

## Todo:

LinkedList - Python -> Turing Machine

Red Black Trees - C++ -> Expression Tree

Priority Queue - Javascript -> Reading Queue

(something with string compression using huffman coding)
